# Disolv (formerly Datasim)

This is the first implementation of Disolv, which was carried out in Python. 
The performance could have been better. Hence, this project is deprecated in favour of Rust-based implementation.

You can find the Rust project [here](https://github.com/nagacharan-tangirala/disolv).

This project is no longer in development.
