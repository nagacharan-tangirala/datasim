# PAVENET

Protocol Agnostic VEhicular NETwork simulator is a tool for simulating data exchange
in the vehicular network. It does not depend on any specific protocol, but it is
designed to capture the data exchange in VANETs of any kind. It is based on the
agent-based modeling and simulation library
mesa (https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
